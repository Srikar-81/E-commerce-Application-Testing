# E-commerce- Demo Application-Testing

**Automation Testing Project: Learning from a Senior’s Blueprint**
This project is a hands-on implementation based on a reference video by a senior developer from my course. The goal is to understand the fundamentals of Automation Testing by following a real-world example. By replicating this senior's project, I gain practical insights and a clear vision for building my own testing framework.

**Project Focus:**
E-commerce Application Testing:
The tests are specifically designed for an e-commerce platform, ensuring key functionalities—such as product search, cart operations, and checkout processes—work seamlessly.
I am automating this project solely to gain real-world knowledge from the video lecture and deepen my understanding of automation testing principles.
